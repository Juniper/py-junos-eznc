# In general, a "fact" should be a piece of information that does not change
# over the life of a PyEZ connection. While things like mastership state can
# change, they also result in the PyEZ connection being closed, so it can
# be considered a fact. Things like number of routes in the route table or
# system uptime do not maintain the same value over the life of a PyEZ
# connection and should therefore not be considered facts.

# The name of this file should be based on the RPCs which are invoked by this
# file. This avoids accidentally invoking the same RPC multiple times when we
# could invoke it just once and gather multiple facts from the output.

# The file must include a provide_facts() function
# The provide_facts() function must return a dictionary. The keys of the
# dictionary are each fact that is handled/returned by this module. The value
# of each item in the dictionary is the documentation string describing the
# particular fact.

# The file must include a get_facts(device) function. The get_facts(device)
# function takes a single mandatory device argument which is the Device object
# on which the fact is discovered.
# The get_facts(device) function must return a dictionary with a key for each
# fact that is handled/returned by this module.
# The get_facts(device) function should raise an appropriate exception if the
# response from the device prevents getting value(s) for ALL of the facts
# provided by the module. The example gets the 'foo' and 'bar' facts.
# An exception should only be raised if the error prevents getting the value
# for the 'foo' fact AND prevents getting the value for the 'bar' fact. If
# unable to determine the value for a given fact, then set the value for that
# fact to None.
