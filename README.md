# ABOUT

![PyEZ logo](static/PyEZ.png?raw=true "PyEZ logo")

_Junos PyEZ_ is a Python library to remotely manage/automate Junos devices.  The user is ***NOT*** required: (a) to be a "Software Programmerâ„¢", (b) have sophisticated knowledge of Junos, or (b) have a complex understanding of the Junos XML API.  

This library was built for two types of users:

## For "Non-Programmers" - Python as a Power Shell

This means that "non-programmers", for example the _Network Engineer_, can use the native Python shell on their management server (laptop, tablet, phone, etc.) as their point-of-control for remotely managing Junos devices. The Python shell is an interactive environment that provides the necessary means to perform common automation tasks, such as conditional testing, for-loops, macros, and templates.  These building blocks are similar enough to other "shell" environments, like Bash, to enable the non-programmer to use the Python shell as a power-tool, rather than a programming language.  From the Python shell a user can manage Junos devices using native hash tables, arrays, etc. rather than device-specific Junos XML or resorting to 'screen scraping' the actual Junos CLI.

## For "Programmers" - Open and Extensible

There is a growing interest and need to automate the network infrastructure into larger IT systems.  To do so, traditional software programmers, DevOps, "hackers", etc. need an abstraction library of code to further those activities.  _Junos PyEZ_ is designed for extensibility so that the programmer can quickly and easily add new widgets to the library in support of their specific project requirements.  There is no need to "wait on the vendor" to provide new functionality.   _Junos PyEZ_ is not specifically tied to any version of Junos or any Junos product family.

# FEATURES

_Junos PyEZ_ is designed to provide the same capabilities as a user would have on the Junos CLI, but in an environment built for automation tasks.  These capabilities include, but are not limited to:

* Remote connectivity and management of Junos devices via NETCONF
* Provide "facts" about the device such as software-version, serial-number, etc.
* Retrieve "operational" or "run-state" information as Tables/Views
* Retrieve configuration information as Tables/Views
* Make configuration changes in unstructured and structured ways
* Provide common utilities for tasks such as secure copy of files and software updates

# NOTICES

- As of release 2.0.0, _Junos PyEZ_ requires [ncclient](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ncclient) version 0.5.2 or later.
- When using the `ssh_private_key_file` argument of the Device constructor on MacOS Mojave and higher, ensure that the SSH keys are in the RSA format, and not the newer OPENSSH format.
  - New key: `ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa`
  - Convert an existing OPENSSH key: ``ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/private_key`
  - Check if a given key is RSA or OPENSSH format: `head -n1 ~/.ssh/private_key`
    - RSA: `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`
    - OPENSSH: `-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----` 

# INSTALLATION

## PIP

Installation requires Python >=3.5 and associated `pip` tool

    pip install junos-eznc

Installing from Git is also supported (OS must have git installed).

	To install the latest MASTER code
	pip install git+https://github.com/Juniper/py-junos-eznc.git
	-or-
	To install a specific version, branch, tag, etc.
	pip install git+https://github.com/Juniper/py-junos-eznc.git@<branch,tag,commit>

## Docker

### Interactive Docker Usage

Move to the local directory which contains your script(s) and run the container. Running the container in this manner will put you into an interactive Bash session.

`docker run -it [ --rm ] [ --name pyez ] -v $PWD:/scripts juniper/pyez`

Your local scripts will be mounted to /scripts in the container.

### Microservice Usage

This image can also be used as a Python "executable" with the required Python PyEZ libraries pre-installed. To use the image in this way, mount the volume which contains the Python script and pass the script name as an argument to `docker run`. Optionally, you may also pass in a `requirements.txt` file to install additional python packages via `pip`. To add OS packages (Alpine Linux), provide a file with a list of packages --one per line-- and either reference it as an env var (`$APK`) or mount it to the container `/extras/apk.txt`. To add additional Python packages (via pip), provide a `requirements.txt` file and pass it in as an env var (`$REQ`) or mount it to the container at `/extras/requirements.txt`.

`Usage: `docker run -it [ --rm ] -v some/dir:/scripts juniper/pyez [ myscript.py ]`

Example:

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/scripts juniper/pyez tmp.py
tmp.py

done
```

## Upgrade

Upgrading has the same requirements as installation and has the same format with the addition of -UPGRADE

	pip install -U junos-eznc


## HELLO, WORLD

The following is a quick "hello, world" example to ensure that the software was installed correctly.  This code will simply connect to a device and display the known facts of the device, like serial-number, model, etc.

````python
from pprint import pprint
from jnpr.junos import Device

with Device(host='my_host_or_ipaddr', user='jeremy', password='jeremy123' ) as dev:
    pprint( dev.facts )
````
Example output for an SRX-210 device:
````python
>>> pprint(dev.facts)
{'2RE': False,
 'RE0': {'last_reboot_reason': '0x20:power-button soft power off',
         'model': 'RE-SRX210H',
         'status': 'OK',
         'up_time': '10 minutes, 3 seconds'},
 'domain': 'workflowsherpas.com'         
 'fqdn': 'srx210.workflowsherpas.com',
 'hostname': 'srx210',
 'ifd_style': 'CLASSIC',
 'model': 'SRX210H',
 'personality': 'SRX_BRANCH',
 'serialnumber': 'AD2909AA0096',
 'switch_style': 'VLAN',
 'version': '12.1X44-D10.4',
 'version_info': junos.versino_info(major=(12, 1), type=X, minor=(44, 'D', 10), build=4)}
